Donkey Kong Jr Deliverable Explanation

Play using A and D for left and right movement and space to jump, click the 3 buttons to change your move speed to 4, 7 and 10 using the DLL. 

Explanation:
As for our implementation for the deliverable, we’ve decided to create a simple Singleton Design Pattern that handles the player’s inputs as it is more an easier design pattern implemented for a low-fidelity copy of the game. The premise of the game handles player movement and jumping, while also adjusting the values of the movement speed of the player. Our iteration of it was used to adjust the value of the player’s move distance based on the button that’s pressed when running, the values were initialized within the .csv file and changed based on the values that were set.


Challenges:
One of the challenges that we faced was being more familiar with the provided plugin example that was gone over in class. We had to find different ways of implementing our own iteration of the plugin that works well within a 2D platformer. Another challenge was with the movement system, at first we did a way harder way of doing the player movement controller so we had to redo this and make it simpler, this wasted a lot of time. If we had gone simple off the bat, we would have finished this in time.
